think about non latin alphabets. make sure your database is ok with them!
and maybe think of some character popups
make it so that the answer choices in the form are a, b, c, and d and you can select any of them to be the correct answer
remember, correct answers are required. if user does not input one yell at them
extension: put letters in answer choices
think about having a cancel and delete button.
