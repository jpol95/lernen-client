        <p>
          Welcome to Fanio! In order to create an account, go to the account
          page. This idea of this website is for folk who are fans of books, tv
          shows, movies, etc. to keep track of their fandoms, write reviews,
          and, eventually connect with eachother via live chats. You can set up
          a profile once you sign up by providing basic information like your
          name, email, interests, hobbies, etc. Once you do that, you will be
          able to create fandoms, installments, sections/sub-sections and
          reviews all with a click of a button. Reviews can have a title, body,
          tags, and number of stars, all easily configurable via a simple form
          when you create a review.
